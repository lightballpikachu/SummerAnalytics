# Dynamic Pricing Engine for Urban Parking Spaces

This project simulates a real-time dynamic pricing engine for 14 urban parking spaces. Static pricing often leads to overcrowding or underutilization of parking lots. By analyzing real-time data streams and using demand modeling, this engine adjusts parking prices intelligently â€” improving space utilization and revenue.

Built as part of a Summer Analytics Course, this project demonstrates the practical application of Python, Pandas, NumPy, and data science concepts in solving urban infrastructure problems.
